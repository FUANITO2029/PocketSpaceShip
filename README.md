Visualize a Space Mission Using Virtual Reality🥽.

This project was created in the hackathon "NASA Space Apps Guanajuato 2023" by team ThunderBees🐝.

Pocket Spaceship aims to illustrate space missions in a simple way to extend public interest. All this thanks to virtual reality technologies. Therefore, you can access our technical demo that we have made from an internet browser on your computer, mobile devices or if you have the opportunity in virtual reality glasses.

Our project allows those curious people who want to live a spatial experience to do so in an easy and accessible way for everyone. And thus, keep alive the illusion of living a space trip.
